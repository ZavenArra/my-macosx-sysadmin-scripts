Note: Free Accounts cannot share a track to multiple groups.
Allmost all users on soundcloud know that problem.
You want to share your tracks in all of your groups (hundreds and tousends), BUT you must click on every group to share the track with.
So your weekend job is clicking all the day on boring links. Not any more.
I found a easy to use solution for you. Run a little script and you share a track within 10 seconds to hundreds of groups.
Listen fine?!?, yeah dude it is.

So just read this few steps and a little video about to do it.

1. You need the script
// 1. Open Share To Group Button for the track you want to share
// 2. Edit group name match - between the // put in what name must match
// watch out, it matches every group that CONTAINS "electro", no matter if this a word or
// a part of a word and its case insensitive
// google for javascript regex syntax to get more informed about the hints of the match
// 3. After you pushed "Execute" or "AusfÃ¼hren" for german peoples
var groupNameMatch = /.*/i;

var i = 1;

$(".create-group").each(function(){

if($(this).attr("href").match(/contributions/i) && $(this).text().match(groupNameMatch)){

    // soundcloud allows only 75 groups to share

        if(i > 75) return false;

            $(this).trigger("click");

                i++;

                }

                });


                2. Open your track you want to share in your groups.
                3. Click on the "Share to Group" button in the Player.
                4. In my example i use firefox and the firebug extensions. You can use every browser that supports development console scripting. (Chrome, Safari).
                5. Put in the code in the console, modify the matching keyword - the groups in very you want to share the track.
                6. Run the script (click on execute or something other to run the script).
                7. Now you can see the popping out notifications for all accomplished group shares. Wait until the messages pops out, when no more notifications visible the process is done.

                TIP: For remove your tracks from groups again replace the first line $(".create-group").each(function(){ with $(".remove-group").each(function(){

                Thats it. Group Share with style ;-)
